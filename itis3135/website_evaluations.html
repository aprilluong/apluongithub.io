        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
      <h3>Good Website:<a href="https://www.aiga.org/"> Aiga</a></h2>
      <p>Contrast: The contrast is mainly white background with black text. But also incorporates bright colors on their visual designs which is visually pleasing and balances the black and white. </p>
      <p>Repetition: On the home page, it has a feature button that users can learn more about their company. Every learn more box is the color blue which indicates the users to find the button easier.  </p>
      <p>Alignment: The header section aligns with the AIGA logo on the left. The grid layout helps the website look more organize and seperate the sections with white space. </p>
      <p>Proximity: In the navigation menu, there are subcategories have dropdown menus that are in close proximity. The images are close to the description of what that section is about. </p>



      <h3>Bad Website:<a href="https://www.buildabear.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-buildabear-us-Site/en_US/Default-Start?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-r-vBhC-ARIsAGgUO2BQ7xPbgYwSqJwYAnhdx9RR_6fSNLKbY24xqHDV-7ZeRFCzmItNGmkaAmesEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=&utm_content=686191219166&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=build%20a%20bear"> Build-a-Bear</a></h3>
      <p>Contrast: The background is white but it is very colorful because of the colors on the stuffed animals. The colors are overwhelming because of the images, there is not really a color concept which makes the user to not pay attention to the website and not know where to look first. 
    </p>
      <p>Repetition: The logo of Build-A-Bear is placed three times. There is a a duplicate subheading that is repeated twice which is Easter Shop, one is with text and the other is with an image and text. The layout is repetitive and does not have any uniqueness to it and distinguishes the stuffed animals.</p>
      <p>Alignment: The logo is at random places that users will not care about. The collaboration and seasonal stuffed animals are the main images with a description on the right of it which has one sentence with a whole bunch of unnecessary white space. The images are very big which seems overwhelming and barely any white space to separate each section. The grid layout is inconsistent and does not align with the grid. 
    </p>
      <p>Proximity: There are way too many navigation menus which makes it feel cluttered. The big images make it inconsistent in spacing because it looks crowded.
