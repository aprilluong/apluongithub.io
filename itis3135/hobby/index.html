            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>Each BTS album offers a unique listening experience, with songs that has a wide variety of genres including love, youth, self-discovery, and social commentary. Their discography reflects their growth as artists and individuals. 

                In addition to the music itself, BTS albums are known for their packaging, which includes things like as photocards, a photobook filled with beautiful photoshoots of the members, and a CD containing the album tracks.</p>
